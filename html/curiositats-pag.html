            <p class="i1">Octopuses have amazing defenses. They can change their coloring to blend in with their surroundings. They can squirt out ink to distract a predator. They can even lose an arm if a predator grabs them. Finally, octopuses can give a nasty bite with their beaks if necessary. Don’t mess with an octopus!</p>
            <h5 class="u1">2.</h5>
            <p class="i1">Most squids are small, but the giant squid is huge. It can grow up to 55 feet long. Most are about 33 feet long. Their eyes are the size of beach balls, which lets them see in the dark ocean.</p>
            <h5 class="u1">3.</h5>
            <p class="i1">Snails and slugs are called gastropods. There are over 80,000 species of gastropods in the world. Some people love to eat snails.</p>
            <h5 class="u1">4.</h5>
            <p class="i1">Clams and mussels live in the sea and rivers.</p>
            <h5 class="u1">5.</h5>
            <p class="i1">Molluscs are invertebrates that include animals such as squid, octopuses, snails, oysters etc. There are an estimated 100,000 species of molluscs making them second largest phylum in the animal kingdom, next to only the Phylum Arthropoda (Insects).</p>
            <h5 class="u1">6.</h5>
            <p class="i1">Molluscs can be found almost everywhere in the deepest ocean floor and also in freshwater and land.</p>
            <h5 class="u1">7.</h5>
            <p class="i1">Over 1,100 species of molluscs have been discovered living deeper than one mile (1600m) below the surface of the ocean. Ewig’s Gastroverm lives at an ocean depth of about 20,000 feet, or nearly four miles (over 4500m!).</p>
            <h5 class="u1">8.</h5>
            <p class="i1">Amazingly the oyster is usually ambisexual. It begins life as a male and then becomes a female. It may go back and forth many times.</p>
            <h5 class="u1">9.</h5>
            <p class="i1">Amazing Fact is that out of the 200 million eggs a female oyster produces only a handful grows to adulthood.</p>
            <h5 class="u1">10.</h5>

            <h5 class="u1">12.</h5>
            <p class="i1">The Humboldt squid can turn itself blood-red. Because this wavelength of light doesn’t travel far underwater, a dark red squid is amazingly invisible.</p>
            <h5 class="u1">13.</h5>
            <p class="i1">The giant clam is a species of molluscs that can grow to weights in excess of 200 Kg and diameters of more than 47 inches. Giant clams inhabit coral reefs throughout the South Pacific and Indian oceans.</p>
            <h5 class="u1">14.</h5>

            <h5 class="u1">17.</h5>
            <p class="i1">Amazingly a snail can travel over a razor blade without harm because it secretes colourless sticky fluid to crawl along.</p>
            <h5 class="u1">18.</h5>
            <p class="i1">The common garden snail (Helix aspersa) can only travel about two feet in three minutes. At that rate, it would travel one mile in five and one-half days.</p>
