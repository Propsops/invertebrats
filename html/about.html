            <p class="i1">Amazing Fact is that out of the 200 million eggs a female oyster produces only a handful grows to adulthood.</p>
            <h5 class="u1">10.</h5>
            <p class="i1">It’s amazing that giant squid eyes are the largest in the animal kingdom about the size of the human head and they can see deep inside sea up to 1000 Feet.</p>

            <h5 class="u1">12.</h5>
            <p class="i1">The Humboldt squid can turn itself blood-red. Because this wavelength of light doesn’t travel far underwater, a dark red squid is amazingly invisible.</p>
            <h5 class="u1">13.</h5>
            <p class="i1">The giant clam is a species of molluscs that can grow to weights in excess of 200 Kg and diameters of more than 47 inches. Giant clams inhabit coral reefs throughout the South Pacific and Indian oceans.</p>

            <h5 class="u1">17.</h5>
            <p class="i1">Amazingly a snail can travel over a razor blade without harm because it secretes colourless sticky fluid to crawl along.</p>
            <h5 class="u1">18.</h5>
            <p class="i1">The common garden snail (Helix aspersa) can only travel about two feet in three minutes. At that rate, it would travel one mile in five and one-half days.</p>
